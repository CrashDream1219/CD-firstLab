# CD-firstLab: DUI sample based on OpenHarmony

This lab implements a simple example of distributed user interface(DUI) based on OpenHarmony Codelab 'DistributedVideoCodelab'. In this lab, we will indicate a general model which could help developers to standardize DUI programming and reduce their workload. 

The main points of this lab:
- The role of DuiAgent
- Interface selector
- Color blind selector
